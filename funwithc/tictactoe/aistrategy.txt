Min max algos are these things where you can assign points to good / bad moves.
We want to implement something like this.
So what we want to do is have a func that 'plays' out the entire game and adds points on a good move and removes points on a bad move.
AI then plays the move w highest points.
Calc points as follows:- if ai wins a situation, the last move is valued at + 1 else -1 (0 for draw).
System to calc points for non last moves is kinda weird and i don't understand yet. (involves recursion)
Kinda complex, but heres how we can start:-

Step 1:-
Ask user if they want to play against AI + if they want to be player 1 or 2 (0 is 2 humans.)
Then in makeMoves, if human move take input if aiMove run aiMove function which is like so:-
make an Array of available moves that contains all numbers ai can move to.
ai will at random pick one available move.

Step 2:-
To make smarter, make both ai and human pick moves till game ends running the minimax algo.
Then make ai play most optimal move.
